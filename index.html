          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I've worked in the online outdoor retail industry for 5+ years, and
            I've held many positions—from sales to content writing to marketing.
            In my spare time, I love climbing, backcountry skiing, and just
            generally being outdoors. Once I realized <em>why</em> these
            activities draw me in, it made me rethink my career path. Yes, being
            outdoors is awesome, but what I love about climbing is, in fact, the
            problem-solving aspect. How could I incorporate my love for problem
            solving and my growing desire to learn a hard skill into a new
            career path? Enter web development.

          <h3>My Software Engineering Journey</h3>
          <p>
            After much deliberation, research, and soul-searching, I decided to
            go for the career switch. I was craving a challenge—I wanted to
            learn a <em>skill</em> instead of relying simply on corporate
            experience to get me the job fulfillment, purpose, and flexibility I
            felt like I was missing in marketing. So here I am, about to embark
            on a 15-week learning journey with the Flatiron School. I've just
            completed the pre-course, where I've barely scratched the surface of
            how much there is to learn, yet I feel like I've learned so much.
            Actually, I coded this website using a combination of basic HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript that I've learned in the past few weeks. I'll
            continue to update this site as I expand my skillset. Thanks for
            stopping by!
