          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            With roughly 10 years of experience in the outdoor retail industry,
            in positions from sales to marketing, I've been fortunate to gain a
            strong understanding of how e-comm businesses operate. Now I'm
            stoked to become a developer to challenge myself, tap into my
            creative side, and also work in a field of absolutes, not just
            throwing shit at the wall and hoping something will work out.

          <h3>My Software Engineering Journey</h3>
          <p>
            After much deliberation, research, and soul-searching, I decided to
            go for the career switch. I was craving a challengeâ€”I wanted to
            learn a <em>skill</em> instead of relying simply on experience to
            get me the career I wanted. So here I am, about to embark on a
            15-week learning journey with the Flatiron School. I've just
            completed the pre-course, where I've already learned some cool
            stuff. Actually, I coded this website using a combination of basic
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I've learned in the past few weeks.
